## Introduction

Deploy a simple application using ArgoCD.

## Use Case
* Deploy application using CLI
* Deploy application using GUI
* MAke a change and watch autoupdate
* revert change and watch autoupdate - rololback
* 

## Cloud Research
Showed the very very basics of using Argo CD to update a cluster
based on git update.  I'd love to see how it would work with
an environment that can't be auto updated on commit.
