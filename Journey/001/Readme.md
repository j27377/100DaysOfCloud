# BIL01-AZ100 - Create two types of Cost Alerts

## Introduction

Day one I wanted to start with something simple. It is essential to monitor cost.

## Use Case

* Create a Cost alert for $10
* Create a Credit alert for $10

## Cloud Research

From portal went to "Cost Management & Billing" then Budgets. I added a budget with an alert at 90% and 100%. I did not see
any option for Credit so I didn't create that alert.  By going to Subscriptions -> choosing a subscription I was able
to find the Usage + Quotas link.  We don't have any quotas set so I wasn't able to set this up either. I tried
the view cost alerts but was unable to see the budget I created - when clicking on create it said it would be
active in a few hours so I will check again tomorrow.
